Bigcommerce SEO is one of the most misunderstood activities an e-commerce store owner has to deal with. Search Engine Optimization is an art and science in its self, but not something you should spend a fortune on. 

<h2>Common terms and misconceptions</h2> 

SEO with Bigcommerce is not as easy as it seems, but with a little documentation you can optimize your store to get better positions in SERP - the search engine results page.

<ol>
<li><strong>Having a BigCommerce store will bring you in the first page of Google</strong> - This is not the case. Bigcommerce offers you the possibility to fill in SEO title, description and keywords, but you won't rank if you let them blank as many do. When editing a product do not forget to got to Other tab and fill in those details to reflect the main topics about your product.</li>

<li><strong>To get better rankings throw as much text as you can</strong> - Google's Crawlers can crawl images, JavaScript and Flash content too. The study has been published recently when <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/just-how-smart-are-search-robots">SEOMoz asked how smart the search bots really are</a>. That means that text is still the main focus, but you need to make a priority from giving your customers the best experience they can have. And that may include images too.</li>

<li><strong>I have a small PageRank, my online business will die</strong> - Also not true. PageRank is only one of the 200 signals/metrics Google uses to see the importance of your store. More important is the domain authority, age and backlinks. So, stop running after PageRank and start working on getting high quality links form big sites that are well respected. Why PageRank is not so important can be seen in this <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/what-is-googles-pagerank-good-for-whiteboard-friday">video</a>. </li>

<li><strong>Domains do not have PageRank, pages do </strong> - True. When you hear somebody telling you that a given domain has a big PageRank simply fire that guy or send him to the learning board. PageRank is for pages only. So when you see that store.com has a big PageRank then you know that the index page of that site has that given score.</li>

<li><strong>Once you have the first position you're all set</strong> - False. In a highly competitive keyword fight you need to post/publish pages for a given keyword at least once a week to maintain your current ranking. Also, work on getting always new good backlinks. SEO means that you need to constantly work and fight your way to remain in the best positions. It is not a thing once done and then you can forget about it.</li>

<li><strong>I have to spend a fortune on SEO work </strong> - False. Basic SEO, like the one we will discuss here, can be done by everyone who understands the core functions of this activity. Yes, that means that you will have to learn a LOT, but you'll save thousands of dollars. </li>

<li><strong>SEO is too complicated </strong> - False. The core function of SEO activity is to optimize your pages in order to get the best rankings possible. At the most basic level you need to see what are the main topics that your product applies to. If you sell inkjet printers then you can see that the main topics for them are: inkjet printer, office printer, home printer, small office inkjet printer, cheap inkjet printer, high quality printer. These words define your printer, and guess what: these words ARE your keywords that you will be using during SEO for your products. This is where it all starts! </li>

<li><strong>Having a ton of backlinks will save me  </strong> - True and false. If those links come from sites with authority then you are saved. On the other side, if you get thousands of links from sites that are bar none for Google you won't get better rankings. A link form CNN values way more than 50 links from an unknown site, regardless of the PageRank of the page that link is located on. We do not recommend using automated tools for backlink building or link exchange. They do not offer value. Instead, if you get too many links in a short period of time Google may sense that something is not right and drop you from you position. </li>

<li><strong>I've done SEO by the book, but nothing has changed</strong> - True. Doing SEO won't bring you in the best positions right on the spot. It may take even weeks or months before you will be able to show up in pages 3, 2 or 1. And that means that you need to constantly work on your optimization. </li>

</ol>
