<p>Since I started writing the BigCommerce SEO Bible series I knew that we would one day need to have all the tips and tricks packaged together in an easy to read ebook. Today we are officially launching that ebook, and we are calling it the <strong>BigCommerce SEO Bible</strong>.  </p>

<p>Over three months in the making (with over 100 hours of research work), this guide outlines the starting steps you need to take in order to get your BigCommerce store "out there". Out there is the wild wild world of the Internet and, most importantly, of search engines. BigCommerce SEO Bible is an introductory guide to SEO and it isn't meant to offer in depth studies for SEO professionals. However it does feature useful, actionable information distilled from sources like <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog" target="_blank">SEO Moz</a>, <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/" target="_blank">Search Engine Journal</a>, <a href="http://www.seobook.com/blog" target="_blank">SEO Book</a> and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/" target="_blank">Search Engine Land</a>.</p>
