Hi *|FNAME|*,

We write about a lot of things, but we want to know what YOU want to read about on our company blog. So let us know what you want to read about by completing a one question survery here.

Here is the latest BigCommerce design customization post: The Easiest Way to Change Colors and Backgrounds in Your BigCommerce Templates.

This post will show how you can change the color and background of most elements in the store. The tutorial was created for the Default Template, but it should work for most of the other templates. You will be able to change the color of the menu items, the background of the site or the color of the texts in the side panels, home new product panels and featued products panel. If you encounter any issues please take time to leave a comment and we'll get right to work and solve the issue.

On the SEO front there is not much to say, except the fact that there are still some SEO issues that need to be resolved in BigCommerce and, of course, we are all eagerly awaiting for the new design of the stores (early September, unofficial date). 

Happy ecommercing!
